# Rock Clusters GX
## What is this?
This is the source code for Rock Clusters GX, a game made by WASDnm (AKA OPagel) in GameMaker. You can play the game for free [here](https://wasdnm.itch.io/rock-clusters-gx). The only program needed to build the game is GameMaker.
## What is Rock Clusters GX?
 Here, you control Jettis, an astronaut trying to traverse and climb the Rock Clusters. This is an endless high-score based game where the objective is to reach the top of the randomly-generated Rock Clusters. You must avoid the green rocks, and attack the yellow ones if they get in your way. Your blaster can also be used to shrink any Rocks that its projectile touches.

Since every section is randomly-generated, not all of them are possible. You can press R on the keyboard or Options on a controller to change the layout of the current section at the cost of some health. This does not increase the amount of sections you've gone through.
